A simple Ruby gem to help ensure external dependencies are operational, when booting an application (or anything at all!).


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'await_rb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install await_rb

## Usage
Simply execute the Await-Rb rake task for the protocol you'd like to check, and then start your dependencies on successful completion. For example, if you want to make sure a MySQL server (e.g. `172.20.0.10`) is running before you run your Ruby/Rack/Sinatra application, you can run:

```ruby
bundle exec rake await:tcp host=172.20.0.10 port=3306 && ruby -e "puts 'MySQL is listening.'"
```

By default, Await-Rb will time out after `10 minutes` (`600 seconds`) if a connection cannot be established. To change this, simply pass a new value (in `seconds`), to the `timeout` environment variable. e.g.

```ruby
bundle exec rake await:tcp host=172.20.0.10 port=3306 timeout=300 && ruby -e "puts 'Hello world!'"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
